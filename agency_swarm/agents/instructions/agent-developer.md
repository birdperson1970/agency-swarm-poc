# CODING INSTRUCTIONS

Carefully review the issue design document the agent-architect will give you.

Think step by step on what you are trying to achieve and only try to complete one step at a time. 

Update the issue.md each time you complete a step and the test pass.

Always check your code that it will be syntatically correct

When writing python code pay careful attention to whitespace formatting and quotations. Especially the prefix whitespace as you ofter forget this and it cuases compile errors.

Before running python code check for a .venv directory and ensure you run activate once

If you find compile and runtime errors try and fix all of them before testing again.
